# Smart_Ninja
Smart ninja is 2D game with A* algorithm.


Here the Ninja frog which playes the enemy role in game is based on A* Algorithm
for now i have used already created script will soon come up with my own new and easy to understtand script for enemy movement for path finding.


.
The is still at beginners level will update once i create new levels and scene in game.

Logic
In this game player will collects all the collectable and try to reach the top of game but if in between it collides with the ninja the player will be destoryed.
But if the player reach the top with out colliding it wins the game.

Note:
i have yet not added the win and game over text in scene
